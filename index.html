        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Conventional accounting practices in extractive industries systematically
          overstate income by failing to deduct the economic cost of non‑renewable
          resource depletion. This leads to financial statements that present
          unsustainable earnings as if they were genuine profits, misinforming
          stakeholders and undermining capital maintenance. This paper proposes
          a comprehensive user cost accounting framework that integrates natural
          capital depreciation, carbon budget constraints and reinvestment
          behaviour into corporate financial reporting. Inspired by Keynes and
          El Serafy, the user cost approach differentiates between true
          sustainable income and asset liquidation, allocating a portion of
          resource rents for capital replacement to ensure intergenerational
          equity. The framework is developed in eight dimensions: a critical
          review of traditional vs. sustainable accounting; creation of a
          reinvestment scorecard to measure capital replenishment performance;
          introduction of a Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC) to
          align discounting with long‑term societal preferences; construction
          of dual financial statements contrasting conventional and sustainable
          reporting; extension to carbon budget accounting as an emissions
          depletion model; integration of human and social capital depreciation
          metrics; exploration of blockchain technologies to secure ESG data
          transparency; and policy recommendations for standard‑setters and
          regulators. Empirical validation includes case studies of
          Freeport‑McMoRan, Anglo American and Ørsted. The study contributes a
          novel, operationalisable framework for sustainability accounting in
          extractive sectors, aligning corporate financial metrics with
          long‑term resource stewardship and climate constraints.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The growing global emphasis on sustainability, climate risk, and the energy transition, which can drastically shorten the economic 
          life of fossil fuel and mineral reserves, demands more accurate and forward-looking financial reporting in extractive industries [1]. 
          Under traditional accounting (e.g., U.S. GAAP or IFRS), resource extraction profits are largely treated as current income without fully 
          recognizing the diminution of the underlying natural asset base[2]. For example, depletion is often recognized via units-of-production 
          amortization or tax-based percentage depletion allowances, which allocate historical costs but do not reflect the economic loss of finite 
          resource wealth. As a result, a mining or oil company might appear profitable while it is effectively liquidating its resource assets, potentially
          misleading stakeholders about long-term sustainability [3][4]. The consequences of ignoring resource depletion are becoming more severe in an era of
          potential “peak oil” [3] and rapid climate-policy shifts that could strand fossil fuel assets (e.g., unburnable carbon) well before physical exhaustion [4].
          Prior research in green national accounting and “genuine savings” has demonstrated that standard profit measures overstate sustainable income when resource depletion 
          and environmental degradation are ignored. For instance, Hartwick’s rule [5] showed that if all rents from exhaustible resources are invested in reproducible capital, 
          consumption can remain constant indefinitely, a theoretical underpinning for sustainability in an economy with depleting resources. Hamilton [6] extended these ideas by
          calculating changes in wealth per capita including natural capital, demonstrating that many resource-rich countries were experiencing declining wealth when proper adjustments were made.
          This mirrored earlier concerns by Daly [7], who argued that genuine sustainable development requires reinvestment of resource rents into forms of wealth that can support future well-being. 
          These insights underscore that treating resource windfalls as pure income is dangerous; some portion must be set aside to preserve future capacity.
          This paper proposes and discusses a user cost accounting framework for extractive industries, a value-based approach initially inspired by Keynes [8] and developed by El Serafy [9],
          to address these shortcomings in corporate financial reporting. Under the user cost concept, only a fraction of extraction revenue is treated as true income, with the remainder set 
          aside to invest in replacement capital, thereby maintaining the productive base of the firm or economy [10]. In essence, user cost accounting treats a portion of resource revenue 
          analogously to a depreciation charge on natural capital [11]. This idea operationalizes Hicks’s definition of income (the amount one can consume without reducing future capacity) 
          for non-renewable resources: part of the resource rent must be preserved to secure future income streams [12]. We build on these foundations and extend them to modern corporate 
          accounting, including not only natural resource depletion but also climate constraints and social impacts.

          Our contributions are both conceptual and practical, and can be summarised as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Critical Review of Conventional vs. Sustainable Accounting:</strong> We review the limitations of traditional accounting methods for depletion and contrast them with the sustainable income concept.
            We bridge academic and professional discourse to ensure our framework is practical, not just theoretical. We clarify the theoretical underpinnings of user cost and sustainable income, and 
            show mathematically how user cost accounting can be integrated into financial reporting.</li>
          <li><strong>Reinvestment Scorecard Development:</strong> Building on new case studies, we propose a quantitative Reinvestment Scorecard with concrete metrics and thresholds [13]. This scorecard evaluates how 
            effectively an extractive company is reinvesting resource rents into sustainable assets or diversification. We define benchmarks for “High”, “Moderate”, and “Low” performance on key 
            indicators (e.g., the percentage of CapEx in renewable or alternative projects, reserve replacement ratio, carbon intensity improvements).</li>
          <li><strong>Introduction of Sustainability-Weighted Discount Rates (SWACC):</strong> We refine the user cost formula by examining the choice of discount rate [14]. Traditionally, the firm’s cost of 
            capital (a private discount rate) is used, but we introduce a Sustainability-Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC) that blends the corporate WACC with a lower “social” discount rate via a 
            factor λ (lambda). We explore how λ can be dynamically adjusted over time based on reserve depletion profiles or external policy changes. For example, as reserves dwindle or as carbon 
            budgets tighten, λ can be increased to place more weight on the social rate, thus increasing the user cost charge to reflect greater emphasis on sustainability.</li>
          <li><strong>Dual Financial Reporting, Conventional vs. Sustainable Accounts:</strong> We translate the theoretical framework into a dual reporting format. Using Freeport-McMoRan’s 2023 financial data as 
            an illustrative case, we construct side-by-side income statements and balance sheets under (A) traditional accounting and (B) sustainable accounting with user cost. This tangible 
            illustration shows, line by line, how revenue, expenses, and profits would be adjusted. In our sustainable version, we introduce a “User Cost (Natural Capital Depreciation)” expense that
            reduces the recognized income. We also show how the accumulated user cost is carried on the balance sheet as a form of replacement reserve fund rather than being paid out or consumed.</li>
          <li><strong>Carbon Budget Accounting Extension:</strong> We extend the framework to address climate change by developing a carbon budget depletion accounting method. We treat a company’s allowable emissions
            (under a given climate target) as a finite resource akin to a mineral reserve. Using Science Based Targets initiative guidance and climate models, we illustrate how a carbon-intensive
            company can calculate its total carbon budget (e.g., the total CO₂ it can emit from now until 2050 under a 1.5°C scenario) and then allocate an annual “carbon depletion charge” as it emits [15].
            We provide a case example with an illustrative depletion schedule for Anglo American’s operational emissions, given its net-zero commitments by 2040 [16].</li>
          <li><strong>Incorporating Human and Social Capital Costs:</strong> Recognizing that sustainable income must also account for human and social dimensions, we propose an extension of the user cost paradigm 
            to human and social capital [17]. Extractive operations can degrade human capital (through worker injuries, skill depletion) and social capital (through community impacts and conflict). 
            We outline how companies might estimate a Human Capital User Cost (e.g., based on training investment needed to offset workforce turnover or lost productivity from injuries) and a Social
            Capital User Cost (e.g., based on community investments needed to offset social impacts or the economic cost of social conflicts). While these are more challenging to quantify 
            than natural capital depletion, we provide illustrative approaches to include these costs in the sustainable income framework.</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation Tools, Blockchain and Data Transparency:</strong> To support practical adoption, we explore how emerging technologies can facilitate trustworthy reporting of sustainable income.
            We discuss blockchain-based ESG data tracking systems that provide an immutable record of production, emissions, and reinvestment data [18][19]. We highlight a real pilot [20] where 
            multiple mining companies and stakeholders share ESG data via decentralized identities and data trusts, enhancing verification while preserving privacy. These approaches can build 
            stakeholder trust in the new accounting measures by ensuring verifiability (countering greenwashing) and proper use of funds earmarked for sustainability.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy Implications and Key Recommendations:</strong> We examine the policy and standard-setting implications of our framework [21]. Regulators and accounting standard-setters aiming to 
            strengthen sustainability reporting can draw on these concepts for new guidelines. We offer specific actionable recommendations, summarised in a “Key Policy Recommendations” section, 
            such as mandating a supplemental “Statement of Resource Earnings and Reinvestment” in financial reports, or providing tax incentives for reinvesting in renewable capital. We align our suggestions with current regulatory trends (e.g., the SEC’s climate disclosure proposal [20] and the EU’s CSRD) to demonstrate feasibility. By prioritizing the top two to three measures, we provide a roadmap for policymakers to drive adoption of sustainable income accounting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, our paper integrates theory, empirical analysis, and practical guidance to argue that user cost-based sustainable income reporting can enhance transparency and long-termism 
          in extractive industries.

        <h2>2. Literature Review section</h2>
        <h2>2.1 User Cost Accounting and Sustainable Income</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of sustainable income is grounded in the idea of Hicksian income,
          the maximum amount one can consume in a period without reducing the ability to
          consume the same amount in the future. For an economy 
          or a firm that relies on depleting natural resources, true income must exclude 
          the portion of revenue that comes from consuming those resources. Salah El Serafy’s 
          “user cost” method formalised this idea for non‑renewable resources by splitting
          each period’s resource revenue into two parts: (1) a true income component that
          can be safely consumed, and (2) a user cost component that represents the 
          depreciation of natural capital and must be reinvested to sustain future income.
          In other words, El Serafy’s method “splits the revenue from the sale of an
          exhaustible resource into a capital element (or ‘user cost’) and a value‑added
          element representing true income.” The income portion is what the firm or
          economy can count as profit without impoverishing future periods, while the 
          user cost portion is reserved to maintain future income streams once the
          resource is depleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic logic can be illustrated simply: when a company sells a barrel of oil 
          or a ton of copper ore, it is partly drawing down its wealth. Only some of the 
          revenue from that sale is analogous to an income or yield on capital (which can be consumed);
          the remainder is akin to liquidating an asset. If sustainable
          income is the goal, a portion of the proceeds must be set aside and converted
          into another form of capital so that when the resource is gone, the company can
          still generate income at the same level.
          This is analogous to the famous Hartwick rule at the micro level, ensuring that resource rents are
          not simply treated as windfall profits but are used to secure the future.
        </p>

<h2>2.2 El Serafy’s Formula</h2>
<p>
  El Serafy (1989) provided a simple model to determine the split between true
  income (<strong>X</strong>) and user cost (<strong>R – X</strong>) for a depleting resource.
  The model assumes a non‑renewable resource will generate a constant net revenue
  (rent) <strong>R</strong> each year over a finite horizon of <em>n + 1</em> years (years 0 through n,
  inclusive). In practice, one might use a proxy like Earnings Before Interest,
  Tax, Depreciation, Depletion &amp; Amortization (EBITDDA) for <strong>R</strong>, to represent
  the net cash flow from the resource. After year n, the resource is exhausted
  and produces no further revenue. A constant discount rate <em>r</em> is used,
  representing the return on investment at which saved user cost will grow.
</p>
<p>
  Under these assumptions, the sustainable income portion each year is given by:
</p>
<p class="formula">
  <strong>X</strong> = <strong>R</strong> × &#40;1 &minus; (1 / ((1 + r)<sup>n+1</sup>))&#41;
</p>
<p>
  and the corresponding user cost (depletion charge) each year is:
</p>
<p class="formula">
  <strong>User Cost</strong> = <strong>R</strong> &minus; <strong>X</strong> = <strong>R</strong> / (1 + r)<sup>n+1</sup>
</p>
<p>
  The fraction of revenue that can be considered true income is therefore
  1 &minus; (1 / (1 + r)<sup>n+1</sup>), and the fraction that must be reinvested as user cost is
  1 / (1 + r)<sup>n+1</sup>. For example, if the time horizon is 25 years (<em>n</em> = 24)
  and the discount rate is 5 percent, roughly 38 percent of each year’s revenue
  would need to be reinvested and about 62 percent could be treated as income.
  If <em>r</em> is lower or <em>n</em> is longer, the required reinvestment fraction increases,
  because it’s harder to sustain the same level of income when either growth is
  slow or the resource lasts fewer years.
</p>
<p>
  This user cost approach has been influential in the field of environmental and resource accounting. 
  It operationalizes the Hicksian income concept in practical terms and has been applied primarily in national
  accounting to adjust GDP or NDP (Net Domestic Product) for resource depletion. For example, the World Bank’s 
  concept of Adjusted Net Saving (also known as genuine saving) incorporates a deduction for the depletion of
  natural resources, inspired by methods like El Serafy’s [20]. By separating income from depletion, one can
  measure what some have called sustainable yield or permanent income from resource extraction [6][10]. Studies
  have shown that ignoring this separation leads to significant overestimation of income [23]. Yaduma et al.
  note that standard national accounts count natural resource rents as income “without making a corresponding 
  adjustment to the depleted natural capital stock,” thereby producing misleadingly high GDP figures [24].
  In fact, treating the entirety of resource revenue as income is equivalent to a country (or company) 
  selling off its assets and calling the proceeds profit.
  A number of empirical studies underscore the magnitude of this overstatement. For instance, in Brazil and Indonesia, 
  early applications of the user cost and related approaches revealed that a substantial portion of what was recorded
  as mining income would need to be set aside to preserve wealth . In Peru, it was estimated that during 1992–2006 the
  conventionally measured mining GDP was overstated by as much as 31–51% once the loss of mineral wealth was accounted
  for . Similarly, Mardones and del Rio (2019) find that for Chile (1995–2015) proper depletion accounting would reduce
  measured mining-sector GDP by nearly 98% (almost wiping out the measured mining GDP growth) . The World Bank (2006) 
  reported that after deducting resource depletion, countries like Bolivia saw their genuine savings rate turn negative,
  meaning they were on an unsustainable development path despite positive GDP growth [24]. These findings highlight that
  a significant share of extractive revenues is not income at all, but rather running down capital. In corporate terms,
  failing to account for this means that firms could be paying out dividends from what is effectively capital liquidation,
  thus undermining their long-term financial health.
  To address these issues, the user cost concept in corporate reporting would treat a portion of revenues as a provision
  for capital maintenance. This is analogous to depreciation but for natural capital. There is an important connection 
  here to classical economics and the work of John Maynard Keynes: the term user cost in fact originates from Keynes (1936),
  who used it in the context of the cost of using up capital equipment. In our context, the “equipment” is 
  a mineral reserve or oil field [9]. By reviving this concept, modern sustainability accounting is essentially
  extending traditional accounting’s accrual logic (which matches the consumption of produced capital over time
  via depreciation) to natural capital. If adopted, user cost accounting would ensure that a company’s financial
  statements reflect the true, maintainable earnings. Only the portion of revenue that can be earned indefinitely 
  (through reinvestment of the rest) is counted as income, aligning financial reporting with the Hicksian income ideal.

        <h2>4. Reinvestment Scorecard</h2>
        <p>
          To assess how extractive companies reinvest resource rents into new
          capital, we introduce a <strong>Reinvestment Scorecard</strong> that
          evaluates firms across multiple dimensions. The scorecard provides a
          qualitative rating—Low (L), Medium (M), Medium/Low (M/L), High (H) or
          Unknown (UK)—for each criterion. A high score indicates that the
          company is allocating a significant portion of its earnings toward
          replacing and expanding its asset base, while a low score suggests
          the company may be consuming its natural capital and risking
          unsustainable operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table below summarises the scorecard results for three
          representative companies—Freeport‑McMoRan, Anglo American and Ørsted.
          The categories include a sustainable capital expenditure (CapEx) ratio,

        <h2>5. Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC)</h2>
        <p>
          A pivotal input in calculating user cost is the discount rate used to
          determine how much of today’s revenue must be saved to sustain future
          income. Corporate accounting typically employs a Weighted Average
          Cost of Capital (WACC) reflecting investors’ required return,
          whereas intergenerational equity implies using a much lower social
          discount rate. To bridge these perspectives, we define the
          <strong>Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC)</strong> as a
          weighted blend of the corporate cost of capital and a social rate:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
          <em>r<sub>SWAAC</sub> = (1 − λ) r<sub>corp</sub> + λ r<sub>social</sub></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          where λ (lambda) ranges from 0 to 1. When λ = 0 the firm uses its
          traditional WACC; when λ = 1 the firm fully adopts a social rate. A
          higher λ implies a lower effective discount rate and therefore a
          larger user cost set‑aside. The interactive chart below illustrates
          how the effective discount rate declines as the weight on
          sustainability increases. Hover over the line to see the exact

        <h2>7. Carbon Budget Accounting</h2>
        <p>
          Meeting global climate goals means that companies must operate within
          finite carbon budgets. We illustrate a hypothetical depletion
          schedule for Anglo American’s operational (Scope 1+2) emissions.
          Starting from a total allowable carbon budget of 50 Mt CO₂, the
          schedule shows projected emissions reductions toward net zero. The
          budget shrinks over time as emissions are released. If emissions
          reductions lag, the remaining budget falls more quickly, signalling
          the need for corrective action.

        <h2>8. Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          The case studies reveal substantial differences between conventional and
          sustainable accounting results. Companies with high reinvestment and
          rapid decarbonisation strategies—such as Ørsted—show more
          resilient business models, while firms with low reinvestment scores
          risk erosion of their asset base and stranded assets from future
          climate policy. The SWACC framework makes explicit the implicit
          assumptions about intergenerational discounting, allowing investors
          and regulators to calibrate sustainability preferences. Dual
          reporting highlights how profits shrink once natural capital
          depreciation is recognised. Carbon budget accounting provides a
          tangible early warning system: if actual emissions exceed the
          planned decline path, the firm’s remaining carbon budget rapidly
          dwindles, signalling a potential need for asset impairments or
          accelerated transition investments.

        <h2>9. Conclusion and Future Research</h2>
        <p>
          User cost accounting provides a robust framework for aligning
          corporate finance with sustainability objectives. By reserving a
          portion of resource rents for capital renewal, firms ensure that
          today’s profits do not come at the expense of tomorrow’s capacity.
          Integrating discount‑rate adjustments, carbon budgets and social and
          human capital measures into this framework yields a comprehensive
          approach to sustainable income measurement. Future research may
          extend the scorecard to include biodiversity and ecosystem services,
          refine SWACC calibration using empirical estimates of societal time
          preferences, and pilot blockchain‑based assurance platforms to
          enhance ESG data integrity. Policy makers should consider requiring
          supplemental “Statements of Resource Earnings and Reinvestment” and
          encourage adoption of SWACC‑adjusted discounting in financial
          reporting standards. As resource constraints and climate risks
          intensify, user cost accounting offers a path toward more resilient
          and equitable economic outcomes.
