        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Conventional accounting practices in extractive industries systematically
          overstate income by failing to deduct the economic cost of non‑renewable
          resource depletion. This leads to financial statements that present
          unsustainable earnings as if they were genuine profits, misinforming
          stakeholders and undermining capital maintenance. This paper proposes
          a comprehensive user cost accounting framework that integrates natural
          capital depreciation, carbon budget constraints and reinvestment
          behaviour into corporate financial reporting. Inspired by Keynes and
          El Serafy, the user cost approach differentiates between true
          sustainable income and asset liquidation, allocating a portion of
          resource rents for capital replacement to ensure intergenerational
          equity. The framework is developed in eight dimensions: a critical
          review of traditional vs. sustainable accounting; creation of a
          reinvestment scorecard to measure capital replenishment performance;
          introduction of a Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC) to
          align discounting with long‑term societal preferences; construction
          of dual financial statements contrasting conventional and sustainable
          reporting; extension to carbon budget accounting as an emissions
          depletion model; integration of human and social capital depreciation
          metrics; exploration of blockchain technologies to secure ESG data
          transparency; and policy recommendations for standard‑setters and
          regulators. Empirical validation includes case studies of
          Freeport‑McMoRan, Anglo American and Ørsted. The study contributes a
          novel, operationalisable framework for sustainability accounting in
          extractive sectors, aligning corporate financial metrics with
          long‑term resource stewardship and climate constraints.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The growing global emphasis on sustainability, climate risk and the
          energy transition, which can drastically shorten the economic life of
          fossil fuel and mineral reserves, demands more accurate and
          forward‑looking financial reporting in extractive industries. Under
          traditional accounting (e.g., U.S. GAAP or IFRS), resource extraction
          profits are largely treated as current income without fully
          recognising the diminution of the underlying natural asset base.
          Depletion is often recognised via units‑of‑production amortisation or
          tax‑based percentage depletion allowances, which allocate historical
          costs but do not reflect the economic loss of finite resource wealth.
          As a result, a mining or oil company might appear profitable while it
          is effectively liquidating its resource assets, potentially
          misleading stakeholders about long‑term sustainability. Prior
          research in green national accounting and “genuine savings” has
          demonstrated that standard profit measures overstate sustainable
          income when resource depletion and environmental degradation are
          ignored. For instance, Hartwick’s rule showed that if all rents from
          exhaustible resources are invested in reproducible capital,
          consumption can remain constant indefinitely—a theoretical
          underpinning for sustainability in an economy with depleting
          resources. Hamilton extended these ideas by calculating changes in
          wealth per capita including natural capital, demonstrating that many
          resource‑rich countries were experiencing declining wealth when
          proper adjustments were made. Daly argued that genuine sustainable
          development requires reinvestment of resource rents into forms of
          wealth that can support future well‑being. These insights underscore
          that treating resource windfalls as pure income is dangerous; some
          portion must be set aside to preserve future capacity. This paper
          proposes a user cost accounting framework for extractive industries
          to address these shortcomings.

        <h2>2. Reinvestment Scorecard</h2>
        <p>
          To assess how extractive companies reinvest resource rents into new
          capital, we introduce a <strong>Reinvestment Scorecard</strong> that
          evaluates firms across multiple dimensions. The scorecard provides a
          qualitative rating—Low (L), Medium (M), Medium/Low (M/L), High (H) or
          Unknown (UK)—for each criterion. A high score indicates that the
          company is allocating a significant portion of its earnings toward
          replacing and expanding its asset base, while a low score suggests
          the company may be consuming its natural capital and risking
          unsustainable operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The table below summarises the scorecard results for three
          representative companies—Freeport‑McMoRan, Anglo American and Ørsted.
          The categories include a sustainable capital expenditure (CapEx) ratio,
          reserve replacement rate, financial reinvestment rate, carbon
          transition progress and social &amp; human investment. Hover over any

        <h2>3. Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC)</h2>
        <p>
          A pivotal input in calculating user cost is the discount rate used to
          determine how much of today’s revenue must be saved to sustain future
          income. Corporate accounting typically employs a Weighted Average
          Cost of Capital (WACC) reflecting investors’ required return,
          whereas intergenerational equity implies using a much lower social
          discount rate. To bridge these perspectives, we define the
          <strong>Sustainability‑Weighted Cost of Capital (SWACC)</strong> as a
          weighted blend of the corporate cost of capital and a social rate:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
          <em>r<sub>eff</sub> = (1 − λ) r<sub>corp</sub> + λ r<sub>social</sub></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          where λ (lambda) ranges from 0 to 1. When λ = 0 the firm uses its
          traditional WACC; when λ = 1 the firm fully adopts a social rate. A
          higher λ implies a lower effective discount rate and therefore a
          larger user cost set‑aside. The interactive chart below illustrates
          how the effective discount rate declines as the weight on
          sustainability increases. Hover over the line to see the exact
          values.

          Traditional financial statements report earnings net of

          sustainability, we reconstruct a condensed income statement for
          Freeport‑McMoRan’s 2023 results under two regimes: (A)
          conventional U.S. GAAP/IFRS accounting and (B) sustainable
          accounting incorporating the user cost charge. The table and chart

        <h2>5. Carbon Budget Accounting</h2>
        <p>
          Meeting global climate goals means that companies must operate within
          finite carbon budgets. We illustrate a hypothetical depletion
          schedule for Anglo American’s operational (Scope 1+2) emissions.
          Starting from a total allowable carbon budget of 50 Mt CO₂, the
          schedule shows projected emissions reductions toward net zero. The
          budget shrinks over time as emissions are released. If emissions
          reductions lag, the remaining budget falls more quickly, signalling

        <h2>6. Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          The case studies reveal substantial differences between conventional and
          sustainable accounting results. Companies with high reinvestment and
          rapid decarbonisation strategies—such as Ørsted—show more
          resilient business models, while firms with low reinvestment scores
          risk erosion of their asset base and stranded assets from future
          climate policy. The SWACC framework makes explicit the implicit
          assumptions about intergenerational discounting, allowing investors
          and regulators to calibrate sustainability preferences. Dual
          reporting highlights how profits shrink once natural capital
          depreciation is recognised. Carbon budget accounting provides a
          tangible early warning system: if actual emissions exceed the
          planned decline path, the firm’s remaining carbon budget rapidly
          dwindles, signalling a potential need for asset impairments or
          accelerated transition investments.

        <h2>7. Conclusion and Future Research</h2>
        <p>
          User cost accounting provides a robust framework for aligning
          corporate finance with sustainability objectives. By reserving a
          portion of resource rents for capital renewal, firms ensure that
          today’s profits do not come at the expense of tomorrow’s capacity.
          Integrating discount‑rate adjustments, carbon budgets and social and
          human capital measures into this framework yields a comprehensive
          approach to sustainable income measurement. Future research may
          extend the scorecard to include biodiversity and ecosystem services,
          refine SWACC calibration using empirical estimates of societal time
          preferences, and pilot blockchain‑based assurance platforms to
          enhance ESG data integrity. Policy makers should consider requiring
          supplemental “Statements of Resource Earnings and Reinvestment” and
          encourage adoption of SWACC‑adjusted discounting in financial
          reporting standards. As resource constraints and climate risks
          intensify, user cost accounting offers a path toward more resilient
          and equitable economic outcomes.
